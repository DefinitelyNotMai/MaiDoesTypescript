## Terminologies

1. TypeScript is a:
- "Strongly Typed Language" - demands the specification of types.
- "Statically Typed Language" - types are checked at **compile** time.

2. JavaScript is a:
- "Loosely Typed Language" - does not require type specification.
- "Dynamically Typed Language" - types are checked at **run** time.
